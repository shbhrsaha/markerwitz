# markerwitz

Markerwitz is a human-computer interface that uses pen movements over a surface to drive the cursor position. Our demonstration applies Markerwitz to Sutherland's Sketchpad. This was a final project by Dale Markowitz and Shubhro Saha for COS 583 (Great Moments in Computing) at Princeton University.
